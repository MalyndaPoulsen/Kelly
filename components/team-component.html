        <p class="lead">These three friends met under very unusual circumstances. They were each pusuing vasting different careers when they
          all found themselves getting drunk and gambling in Las Vegas. While Crandall was onstage singing hip-hop, DeDe
          found herslef in a bit of a jam for card counting. She promised to repent and spent the rest of the weekend ...</p>

              <p>Crandall Kyle's introduction to wine started in 1995 with a harvest job at L'Ecole No 41. It was such a fun
                and interesting job, in an industry whose product he enjoyed so much, that his harvest job lasted for 6 more
                years. An accountant by trade, he left there to go work at a public accounting firm, but missed being involved
                with wine. So when an opportunity to make some garage wine came in 2002, he jumped on board. In an effort
                to always make better wine, he decided to take a small-lot winemaking course in 2003 from Stan Clarke, a
                highly respected viticulturist. In this class were several friends of his, and he decided to consolidate
                their carboy's and make it a joint venture. This venture grew into something bigger and bigger and now has
                a name…Plumb Cellars.</p>

                retiring in their mid-30s, they traveled extensively while their children were young.<br> In recent years,
                they owned and operated Brickstone Design Gallery which, through its wine bar and shop, led them to a joint
                partnership with friends to plant a vineyard and make their own wine. Today, Edie and Dale still reside in
                the Walla Walla Valley, where they enjoy relaxing and biking around the local scenery. They have two beautiful,
